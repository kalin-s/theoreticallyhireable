Crowded up against my window, the upper span of smog-stained blue stays constant, while a bright movement of green trees now sweeps by my eyes, earlier only brown concrete structures shuffled.

A man stares at me as we pass him, each scratch on the glass piercing through him, he has a lifeless look as if they actually are. His head tilted, leaning toward the left edge of my window frame, as if the passing green is pushing him back. Perhaps the wind of the motorcycle ride is too strong. 

His driver slows, and he is swept by more green into the remaining pastel blur of it all. 

The sky’s no clearer, but the green grass is pretty here.
